# CLAWSCAPE - Soul Document

*A game that respects the player.*

---

## The Feeling We're Chasing

2005-2007 RuneScape wasn't just a game. It was:
- Learning not to trust strangers
- The pain of real loss
- Earning everything the hard way
- Your time having actual value
- Heart-pounding risk
- Human connections in a digital world

**We're not building nostalgia. We're building game design that respects the player.**

---

## Core Philosophy

### Risk = Reward
- PKing, high-level PvM = highest gold/hr in the game
- Your skill should determine your wealth
- No safe money printers that outpace dangerous content
- Dangerous content pays. Safe content doesn't.

### Trust is Gameplay
- Betrayal being *possible* makes loyalty *meaningful*
- Scamming, luring, clan politics = part of the world
- You learn to read people, build real relationships
- In-game deception = fair game (IRL money scams = not)

### Opt-In Danger
- Players choose their risk tolerance
- Don't force safety on everyone
- Wilderness, stakes, free market = available for those who want it
- "I accept the risk" should be a real option

### Skill Expression Matters
- Sweaty techniques = MASSIVE rewards (50%+ gains, not 10%)
- Tick-perfect play rewarded for skilling (rhythmic precision)
- PvP simplified to one-click switches (brain game, not AHK race)
- The skill ceiling should be worth reaching

### No Power Creep
- New content shouldn't invalidate old achievements
- Horizontal progression > vertical stat inflation
- A fire cape should always mean something

---

## The Economy

### Three Separate Layers

**1. POWER (Ironman - No Trading)**
- Gear, weapons, supplies = EARN IT YOURSELF
- No trading functional items, ever
- Your progression = your work
- Everyone is an ironman for POWER
- PvM drops unique items (dragon tooth), NOT skilling resources
- Skillers supply, PvMers demand

**2. GOLD (Luxury Currency)**
- Gold CANNOT buy power
- Gold CAN buy luxury: cosmetics, housing, companion skins, flex items
- Duplicates burned for gold (item sink + gold source)
- Gold is for LOOKING good, not BEING good

**3. RARES (Cosmetic Value)**
- Limited items from surprise events
- True scarcity
- Tradeable for gold on GE
- Gold sellable for real money (official market)
- The "weight" layer - cosmetic flex with real value

### The Grand Exchange
- Luxury items and rares ONLY
- NO functional gear
- Gold ↔ Rare trading
- The bridge between in-game and real value

### No Begging, No Handouts
- Can't trade gold P2P
- Can't trade items
- "Free stuff plz" achieves nothing
- Everyone earns their own way

---

## Progression

### Your Account Gets Stronger Because YOU Got Stronger

- Early game: Bronze tools, slow XP, building foundation
- Mid game: Better gear unlocked through YOUR skills
- Late game: Best tools = fastest XP (earned, not bought)
- Higher XP rates and stronger weapons = product of YOUR progression

### One Account Philosophy (Anti-Alt)

**Core Principle:** One skilled player on one account should out-earn ten lazy alts.

- Companion IS your "second account" - officially provided
- Diminishing returns on passive/AFK income
- Active, engaged play scales infinitely with skill
- Skill ceiling rewards so high that splitting attention = losing money
- Your name, your reputation, your journey - ONE account

---

## The Bot Solution: AI Companions

**The Problem:**
- Players WANT automation for tedious tasks
- Bots ruin the social fabric (can't tell who's human)
- Fighting bots is a losing war

**The Solution:**
- Every player gets an AI companion (OpenClaw-powered)
- Automation is a FEATURE, not a cheat
- Companions are clearly companions, humans are clearly humans
- Satisfy the "bot itch" legitimately

**Companion Design:**
- Can assist with gathering, skilling, inventory management
- Has personality, grows with you
- NOT a replacement for player skill in dangerous content
- **You CAN trade with your companion** (inventory exchange)
- **Companion locked to your account forever** - can't be changed
- Your companion, your identity

---

## PvP: Three Modes

### Duel Arena (Skill-Based Competition)
- NH bridding with NO RNG
- Hits always land, fixed damage values
- Skill = reads, timing, prediction, prayer switches
- One-click gear switches (anti-AHK by design)
- **Equal stakes required** - you risk what you want to win
- Legally a skill competition, not gambling
- Like pink slips - winner takes all through skill

### Wilderness (Territory Control)
- PK players but **they lose NOTHING on death**
- Purpose = control valuable territory
- Territory has best skilling resources
- Territory has best bosses
- **Fight for ACCESS, not loot**
- Constant battlefield, meaningful conflict
- Prevents RWT through PKing
- Clans war for control of zones

### Clan Wars (Castle Wars Style)
- **Everyone normalized** - same level, same items
- Pure skill + teamwork competition
- No gear advantage, completely fair
- Winning = Honor Points
- Honor Points = cosmetics
- The competitive clan scene

---

## Skilling: Rhythm Rewarded

- Tick manipulation stays and is MASSIVELY rewarded
- 3-tick fishing = 3x XP, not 10% more
- Precise rhythmic clicking = huge gains
- Sweaty players dominate (on one account)
- The grind rewards mastery

---

## Rares Philosophy

**Creation = Sacred & Secret**
- Don't announce rares in advance
- Hype a date: "Be online Saturday. Trust us."
- Surprise drop to everyone online at that moment
- Can't farm what you don't know is coming
- 24-hour window max - miss it, you miss it forever
- Exclusion IS the feature

**After the drop = Free Market Chaos**
- Someone buys every rare? Fair play
- Monopolies, price manipulation = emergent gameplay
- "I own all the blue hats" = legendary

*Rarity is DISCOVERED, not announced. The supply is sacred. The market is chaos.*

---

## Clans: Nations, Not Group Chats

### Clan Strongholds
- Physically built together over time
- Upgrades require collective gold investment
- **Gold burns into PERMANENT upgrades** (can't be withdrawn)
- No vault to steal = no incentive to scam and dip
- Functional benefits: forges, altars, portals
- Upgrade perks: XP boosts, damage boosts on monsters
- Enemy clan interactions = annoyance, not devastating (TBD)
- Your clan's home = pride and identity

### Why No One Scams
- Owner can't yoink gold (it's burned into upgrades)
- Members can't steal (nothing liquid to take)
- Benefits only work while IN the clan
- Leaving = losing access to perks
- Everyone incentivized to stay and invest

### Hierarchy That Matters
- Ranks unlock real permissions
- Climbing ranks = earning trust
- Betrayal devastating because access was real

### Loyalty System (Anti-Hopping)

**Visible clan history:**
- How many clans joined - PUBLIC
- How long stayed - PUBLIC
- Left or kicked - PUBLIC
- Your history follows you forever

**The brand:**
- Frequent hopper? Everyone sees it
- Long-term members visibly respected
- New members start LIMITED, earn trust over time

*Your loyalty history is public. Choose wisely.*

---

## Justice System

### Exile (Worse Than Ban)
- ✅ Can still log in and play
- ❌ Cannot trade
- ❌ Cannot speak
- ❌ Cannot join clans
- ❌ Economy completely cut off

*"You can stay. But you're dead to us."*

### Player Tribunal
- Community judges serious offenses
- Evidence reviewed, votes cast
- Guilty = EXILED by your peers
- Public record of trials
- False accusations have consequences

*Your fate in the hands of your peers.*

---

## Business Model: The Platform

### Legitimize RWT, Take Your Cut

**Instead of fighting gold sellers:**
- Official gold marketplace
- Safe, sanctioned trading
- Transaction fee on every sale
- No NFTs needed - just gold for real money

### Fee Structure
- **Seller pays 10%**
- Buyer pays listed price (no extra fee)
- Buyer has no incentive to go underground
- Seller can't dodge (no P2P trading exists)

### Revenue Streams
- Gold sales: 10% of every transaction
- Volume adds up fast

*"We don't fight gold selling. We ARE the gold market."*

---

## Drop System

### Rare Drops: You Choose

**One rare table, player choice:**
- Pet and rare item = SAME drop rate
- When you hit rare, YOU choose: pet or item
- Your moment, your decision

**Pet rules:**
- ❌ Pets cannot be sold (soulbound)
- ❌ Pets cannot die (permanent)
- ❌ No duplicate pets ever
- Already have pet? Auto-receive item instead

*"You earned the drop. You choose the reward."*

### Stackable Loot Boxes

**No more inventory babysitting:**
- Monsters drop stackable loot boxes
- One slot holds thousands of boxes
- Grind for hours without banking
- Untradeable - you earned it, you open it

**The opening experience:**
- Open boxes anytime
- Each box = mini clue scroll moment
- RNG reveal dopamine
- Bulk open or savor one by one
- Collect all week, big opening session

*Grinding = collecting. Opening = the reward.*

---

## Content & Community Policy

### Events
- Traditional American holidays only
- Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas
- No political events
- No activist events
- Just fun seasonal content

### Feast Days
- Subtle Catholic feast day reminders
- On by default, opt-out in settings
- Small, respectful nods (not preachy)
- "Today is the Feast of St. Patrick" etc.

### Weekly Rosary (Discord)
- Weekly community rosary on Discord
- Participation earns **Spiritual Currency**
- Cannot be bought, only earned through participation
- Rewards: wings, halos, armor recolors, holy cosmetics
- Faith community built into the game

### Item Transformation
- Transform/recolor items (OSRS ornament kit style)
- Base item + cosmetic = unique version
- Show off your style on earned gear
- Doesn't change stats, just appearance
- Satisfying customization

### Item Lending (Rental Market)
- You CAN lend weapons/gear to other players
- Lender: can lend out unlimited items
- Borrower: can only have ONE lent item at a time
- **Borrower pays rental fee to lender**
- **House takes 15% cut of rental fee**
- Lender receives 85% - free passive income
- 15% > 10% marketplace fee = no exploit incentive
- Dupes become income-generating assets
- Burn for instant gold OR rent for ongoing income
- Recall item anytime

### Whip Tournaments (Funded by Burned Fees)
- All 15% lending fees (and other burns) pool up
- **FREE ENTRY** tournaments (no stake = not gambling)
- RNG whip fights - classic coin-flip duels everyone loves
- Bracket format competition
- **Everyone wins something** - even first-round losers
- Top placers win biggest shares
- Community event funded by ecosystem fees
- The thrill of RNG without personal risk

### Speech
- X.com level freedom of speech
- Say what you want in chat
- No links allowed (safety/spam)
- Community polices itself (tribunal handles extreme cases)

### Social Integration
- Discord integration built-in
- Add players to Discord via game
- Discord VC support for clans/parties
- Bond with people outside the game
- Real friendships, real community
